Iteration Plan - By Friday, November 21, 2014

1)	Functionality in regards to students needs to be in place 
	(add/remove student from the class list, modify student properties, 
	ability to belong to a group, has preferences, etc).

2)	Ability to feed class list and settings into a GENERATOR class and 
	get a list of GROUPS back out (although for the near future, generator 
	doesn’t need to do much more than take a group size, and spit out 
	the appropriately sized groups of any students, for this week at least).

3)	Need to implement scheduling, both private and public based. Likely done 
	in one hour blocks by day of week(day of week and 9-10, 10-11, etc).

4)	Basic “rate 1-10” assessment module, with weighted questions, returns something 
	(a number from some sort of weighting formula?).

5)	Need a list of student info for testing, and associated capability to feed 
	into the program with some sort of option during initialization.
	
6)	Some sort of interface, provide basic functionality now, but will be a WIP
	over the course of the project. For now, a Java console with numeric options
	should be enough to show functionality, but since the interface should be
	properly segmented, a GUI can be introduced if desired.
